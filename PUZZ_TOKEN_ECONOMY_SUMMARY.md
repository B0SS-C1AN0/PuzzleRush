# PUZZ Token Economy Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully replaced the XP reward system with a comprehensive PUZZ token economy system that provides real-time token balance tracking, transaction history, and multiple reward mechanisms.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Token Rewards System
- **Level Completion**: 100 PUZZ tokens
- **Perfect Level**: 200 PUZZ bonus (100% words found)

- **Daily Streak**: 150 PUZZ tokens (awarded once per day)
- **Achievement Unlock**: 300 PUZZ tokens

### 2. Real-time Balance Display
- **Top Navigation**: PUZZ token balance displayed prominently in header
- **Wallet Dropdown**: Enhanced with PUZZ balance and transaction history access
- **Auto-refresh**: Balance updates in real-time every second
- **Visual Integration**: Seamless integration with existing game UI

### 3. Transaction History System

  - Total earned tokens
  - Total spent tokens
  - Today's earnings
  - Transaction details with timestamps
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern modal interface with stats cards and visual indicators

### 4. Token Service Architecture

- `src/services/puzzleService.ts` - Updated trait benefits to use PUZZ tokens
- `src/services/honeycomb.ts` - Updated API calls to use PUZZ tokens
- `src/services/blockchainService.ts` - Updated reward mechanisms

### 3. Type System Updates
- Replaced `totalXP` with `totalPuzzTokens` in PlayerProfile
- Updated `xpReward` to `puzzTokenReward` in HourlyPuzzle
- Changed trait benefits from `xp_boost` to `token_bonus`
- Added `master` difficulty level support

## Game Integration
